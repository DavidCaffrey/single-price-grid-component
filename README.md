## My process

- Setup ci/cd through github and netlify
- Add all semantic elements where possible.
- Give all components a class name
- Import fonts
- Create custom css properties
- Create the mobile/responsive layout styles
- Add media queries for desktop browsers

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My approach is becoming more structured and a system or checklist is developing, that is lending itself to an easier development experience.

### Continued development

The purpose of this approach is to develop a system/checklist that can be used on any web project.
